# nnp  
Dockerized NUT, with prometheus exporter

The main idea is creating a container which can collect a monitoring data from a UPS via NUT, and also provides a timeseries data for prometheus. The data conversion is happening on-the-fly with a NGINX+PHP which directly calling the UPSC with a NAME of your UPS defined in the nut.conf.  

For example if your UPS name defined as "effekta" you can collect a metric with prometheus via the following url:

http://localhost:9199/index.php?ups=effekta

#Build a Container: 

docker build . -t nnp_090822_2040

#Run a Container:

Settings:

NGINX listen on 9199
UPSD listen on 3493
UPS variable is your defined name in your ups.conf which located in /media/Config/Nnp
Check where is your device is sitting: (0665:5161) so we have to pass this device to the container.
Alternatively you can use --privileged option instead of a --device. (Insecure way)
